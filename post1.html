        <h1>End of the YEAR????</h1>
        <h2> 12/31/2022 </h2>
        <p> Writing this blog post on New years Eve, I realize that I have so much more that I could be doing with life. 
            When I look back at my 2022 I feel like the big demons that hang over me are still there, I understand what I have to do now thanks to some important things that I've learned throughout this year. 
            Wouldn't change shit about my journey, shit it made me ME, though I wasn't just circling anything on that ACT.
            I just want to keep living my life the way that I want because I love it right now, I have lots of things to appreciate this year.
            But I also have lots to do, lots of ways I could move forward, so much so that I feel like im indecisive. 
            Things change but I get flashes of home in my head and I remember that its alright.
